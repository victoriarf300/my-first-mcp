# My First MCP Server

This MCP server allows Claude Code to save code snippets to my computer using a tool called save_snippet. The tool accepts a name, language, and code, and saves the snippet as a file in the ~/snippets folder.

Installation:
1. Install dependencies using npm install
2. Run the server using node index.js
3. Add the server using claude mcp add

Example usage:
Save a javascript snippet named hello_world. The snippet will be saved locally and can be reused later.
