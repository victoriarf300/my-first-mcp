# MCP Server Build Process

What I built:
I built an MCP server that allows Claude Code to save code snippets as files on my computer. The tool save_snippet creates files in a snippets folder based on the name and language provided.

How Claude Code helped:
Claude Code helped me generate the MCP server code and fix errors. I used prompts asking how to create a save_snippet tool and how to correct SDK import errors.

What I learned:
I learned that MCP servers extend AI tools by adding custom capabilities. The server runs locally and communicates with Claude Code through stdio transport. MCP allows Claude to interact with local files and perform tasks outside its normal abilities.
